logic-midi-scripts
==================

A collection of useful Logic MIDI Scripter scripts, for use with Logic or MainStage.

These are JS files intended to be loaded into the Scripter MIDI plugin to perform some useful functions - especially in live performance. 

If you have any questions about these, or would like some help getting them working please feel free to contact me at:
